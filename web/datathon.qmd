editor: source
---

Do you want to use web data at scale for socio-economic research, but don’t know how to start? Are you interested in exploring large Web Archives for your research but unsure where to begin?

We’ve got you covered.

On 27–28 November 2025 we are organising a **Web Archives for Social Sciences Datathon** at the University of Bristol. This is in collaboration with our partners: the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/){target="_blank"} and [UK Web Archive](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/) at [The British Library](https://www.bl.uk/){target="_blank"}. The datathon will take place at the [BDFI Neutral Lab](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristol-digital-futures-institute/facilities/neutral-lab/){target="_blank"}.

This two-day event will build capacity in the social science research community to use large-scale Web Archive data for policy-relevant, socio-economic research. Participants will work in teams with curated data extracts from the Common Crawl to address real-world research challenges. They will be supported by our expert facilitators.

## Who should apply?

-   Early-career and more established researchers in the social sciences who currently use, or wish to use, web data for their research--especially data from Web Archives.

-   Researchers with technical backgrounds (e.g. data science) who want to apply their skills to Web Archive data for policy-relevant research.

-   Some prior experience with code-based tools (e.g. Python or R) is expected.

## What will you gain?

By the end of the Datathon, you will be:

-   More confident in using Web Archives to address your own research questions.

-   Familiar with the structure, challenges, and opportunities of these data.

-   Equipped with technical expertise for working with Web Archive data at scale.

-   Experienced in using LLM for analysing such web data.

## Practical details

When: 27–28 November 2025

Where: Bristol, BDFI Neutral Lab

Support: Limited financial assistance for travel and/or accommodation is available.

This is a [cache of web data](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u3/nw19521/edJmkqqtL_S3qeUKifXqywRVP/) containing all commercial websites (.co.uk, landing webpages only) archived by the Common Crawl (2021) that (1) include at least one UK postcode in their web text, and (2) we believe represent Financial Services. Identify the different sub-classes (industries) within Financial Services and highlight the websites that provide Fintech services.

2.

3.  This is a cache of web data containing all commercial websites (.co.uk, landing webpages only) archived by the Common Crawl (all of 2021 and 2024) that include at least one postcode from Manchester and Birmingham in their web text. The 2021 commercial websites are classified by economic activity, while the 2024 websites are not. Use the 2021 data to classify the 2024 data for both cities. Compare the industrial structure of these cities and analyse how it evolved overtime. Manchester data for [2021](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u4/nw19521/HkAQ91jMEQjDiziHka2HdwRVD/) and [2024](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u2/nw19521/ulc_qQzIEsoYqvVgVruPwwRV1/) and Birmingham data for [2021](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u1/nw19521/QDGVVWEZ2KpTLTPQSkVW1QRVS/) and [2024](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u1/nw19521/aQ5jRlZIWmHdJfyGmW3YggRVz/).

4.  This is a cache of web data ([part 1](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u3/nw19521/IrZEQOEv5UC0aY8wwm7hgARVX/) and [part 2](https://fluff.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u2/nw19521/9HiSFzR9UOaF01U8ZrmKCARVA/)) containing all the UK governmental webpages (.gov.uk) that have been archived by the Common Crawl (February-March 2024).

Identify changes associated with the new government elected in July 2024.

### Data description



- content: the web text from the landing page of each website

- summary: an LLM-generated summary of the web text

- explanation: an LLM-generated explanation of how the summary of was conducted

- url: the website URL

- parent_url: the website domain	

- postcodes: UK postcodes found	in the web text

The rest of the fields were produced by our [TNT-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12173) based pipeline that classifies websites into a two-level typology of economic activities (high level clusters and low level clusters) using LLMs. These fields are:

- partition_id: high level cluster ID (imagine something like sector)

- label_id: low level cluster ID (imagine something like industry)	

- label_name: low level cluster name (imagine something like industry)

- label_description: low level cluster description (imagine something like industry)
