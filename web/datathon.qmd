Do you want to use web data at scale for socio-economic research, but don’t know how to start? Are you interested in exploring large Web Archives for your research but unsure where to begin?

We’ve got you covered.

On 27–28 November 2025 we are organising a **Web Archives for Social Sciences Datathon** at the University of Bristol. This is in collaboration with our partners: the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/){target="_blank"} and [UK Web Archive](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/) at [The British Library](https://www.bl.uk/){target="_blank"}. The datathon will take place at the [BDFI Neutral Lab](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristol-digital-futures-institute/facilities/neutral-lab/){target="_blank"}.

This two-day event will build capacity in the social science research community to use large-scale Web Archive data for policy-relevant, socio-economic research. Participants will work in teams with curated data extracts from the Common Crawl to address real-world research challenges. They will be supported by our expert facilitators.

### Who should apply?

- Early-career and more established researchers in the social sciences who currently use, or wish to use, web data for their research--especially data from Web Archives.

- Participants with technical backgrounds (e.g. data science) who want to apply their skills to Web Archive data for policy-relevant research.

- Some prior experience with code-based tools (e.g. Python or R) is expected.

### What will you gain?

By the end of the Datathon, you will be:

- More confident in using Web Archives to address your own research questions.

- Familiar with the structure, challenges, and opportunities of these data.

- Equipped with technical expertise for working with Web Archive data at scale.

- Experienced in using LLM for analysing such web data.
