## Royal Statistical Society International Conference, Edinburgh 2025

Emmanouil took part in the panel session about *Doing Good Things with Data* during the [Royal Statistical Society International Conference 2025](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2025/){target="_blank"} in Edinburgh. 

How do we ensure this data truly represents all of society? How do we protect privacy while maximising public benefit? And most importantly, how do we translate these insights into policies that genuinely improve people’s lives? These were the themes explored during the session, which was organised by Smart Data Research UK at the recent Royal Statistical Society International Conference in Edinburgh.

## London Data Week 2024

During the London Data Week we organised a public event about 
[Web Archives: An Untapped Source Of Smart Data](https://londondataweek.org/events/#web-archives-an-untapped-source-of-smart-data){target="_blank"}.

Despite their existence since the early days of the internet, web archives remain 
an underutilised resource with immense potential. The session raised awareness 
about the crucial role of web archives and the institutions dedicated to 
preserving digital history across various national domains. The session 
underscored the transformative potential of web archives as a source of smart 
data for social science research and beyond.
