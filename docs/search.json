    "section": "Project description",
    "text": "Project description\nThis is the website of our Smart Data Research UK project entitled An Atlas of Economic Activities in the UK: tapping into web archives for social science research.\nThis project uses the Web, one of the largest sources of smart data, to map economic activities in the UK at an unprecedented level of detail. Our tools and data products will allow for the continuous monitoring and mapping of economic activities. They can support policy makers to understand how economic activity evolves over time and in different places. Our project showcases the value of the Web as an untapped source of smart data and creates tools for the broader social science community to utilise these data.\nFor this project, we are developing the computational tools that are needed to utilise web data at scale from web archives and, specifically, the Common Crawl. By analysing self-descriptions of economic activities on business websites, we will produce typologies of economic activities that are rich in terms of content and their reach extends beyond small case studies. We will map and model the spatial footprints and the dynamics of economic activities in the UK. By geolocating and observing commercial websites over time we will expose the dynamics of economic activities: from stable industrial clusters to emerging economic activities and their geographies. It will also assess potential biases associated with archived web data. Just like non-digital archives, web archives do not archive everything - be it all public websites (archival extend) or all webpages within a website (archival depth).\nWebsites are archetypal smart data: they are born digital data positioned at the core of what we understand as the internet; they are geospatial as 70% of all websites contain some place reference; they are commercial and transactional since they capture information – often self-reported – about various entities, from individuals to firms and third sector organisations; and they are unstructured, containing textual and visual information, among other things. Despite the utility of web data for social science research, the usage of such rich and big textual data is hindered by a lack of easy-to-access data and relevant tools."

    "text": "We had a blast!\nWe organised a Web Archives for Social Sciences Datathon on 27–28 November 2025 at the University of Bristol. The aim was to increase capacity among social scientists to use large-scale web archived data for policy-relevant, socio-economic research.\nWe partnered with our friends from the Common Crawl and the UK Web Archive at The British Library and we used the amazing the BDFI Neutral Lab.\nWe were so lucky to have 25 briliant participants joining us from as far as Chile and Belgium. We set up five problems – from identifying Fintech and CreaTech firms to tracking policy changes at national and local levels – and we built relevant datasets using data from the Common Crawl based on the work we are doing for the Atlas of Economic Activities project. Over the two days, the participants worked in teams to tckle these problems with the support of our expert facilitators: Emmanouil Tranos, Leonardo Castro Gonzalez, Laurie Burchell and Thom Vaughan. Special thanks to our guest star facilitator, Jon Reades.\nDon’t get me wrong though, the problems were only the excuse. The real benefit was the journey to Ithaca: the collective capacity we built as a team. While I wouldn’t be surprised if these 25 web data warriors could save the world in just 36 hours, the real impact will come later, when they apply these data and methods to their own research questions. And that is why we are so excited.\nAll Datathon materials including the actual problems, the data, the group presentations and the code the teams developed, are openly available at: data.commoncrawl.org."
